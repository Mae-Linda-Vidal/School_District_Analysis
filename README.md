# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to break down the pattern of dishonesty in a possibly altered grade pattern. By replacing the scores of math and reading with NaNs, the sum of each subject scores have changed. Looking at grades 10-12 students and their reading and math scores, the scores seem reasonable. With 29370 students passing only math and 33610 students passing only reading, the total number of students who passed both are lower than each total: 25528. Calculating the average of math and reading scores in each school district, we can oversee which schools have the highest average.
## Results
Ford Highschool has the lowest passing grade (%) in both math and reading, followed by Bailey Highschool and Figueroa High school (Output 91)
